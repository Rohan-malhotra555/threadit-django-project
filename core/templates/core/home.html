                      Django is smart enough to print the *name* of the
                      community (e.g., "python") instead of a

                  :"F d, Y": This is an argument passed to the date filter. It's a format string telling the filter how you want the date to look, using standard codes:

                    F: Full month name (e.g., "October")

                    d: Day of the month, with leading zero (e.g., "05", "26")
